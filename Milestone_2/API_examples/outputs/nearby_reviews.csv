A I,5,One of the nicest all you can eat sushi places in Aveiro. I went for my birthday and really had a great time. The servers speak English and you get your own tablet to order. The restaurant is very spacious and can Accomodations to large groups. It’s not the cheapest but from the other similar places I’ve been to around town it definitely is one of the nicest!

Ta Ma,5,"Returning to this restaurant for the second time, our expectations were once again exceeded. After over ten years of honest exploration in Portugal, I can confidently say that this restaurant stands out as one of the best I’ve ever experienced.

The service was impeccable – helpful, friendly, and authentic. Our request was honored, and we were seated with a view into the kitchen, which added an exciting dimension to our dining experience. The food was flawless, with the daily fish being particularly delicious, along with all the appetizers we sampled.

The wine recommendation was spot-on, perfectly aligning with my tastes as described to the waiter, who demonstrated not only expertise in food but also in wine – a definite plus. The ambiance was charming, with the entire team, aside from the kitchen, exuding warmth. The restaurant’s decor was beautifully curated, adding to the overall experience.

I’m already looking forward to my next visit. This restaurant is my top recommendation for anyone visiting Portugal – don’t miss out on it.",2024-05-02T13:48:07.136594Z,FAMA by Luís Lavrador,ChIJGzl6FF-jIw0RqD2xkPwE8to,"{'latitude': 40.625810900000005, 'longitude': -8.645055}",4.7
Mohannad Jooriah,2,"I went there with a friend to celebrate a professional achievement, and we chose this restaurant based on the reviews we found online. We went there with high expectations but the whole experience was really disappointing!!
Starting with charging the Couvert (bread, butter and pâté) per person, I really do not understand the logic here! What if a group of ten people goes there and only half of them ate the couvert, those who did not eat would still pay 2€ each for something that they didn’t even try?! As starters, we ordered the prawns (6 prawns) and tuna ceviche (both not included in the menu here). They both tasted nice but the ceviche was served as two mini tacos with literally un-chewable mini tortilla. We also got the vegetable soup that was average.
For main dishes we ordered “Braised octopus tentacle” and the “Low temperature oxtail”. The oxtail was acceptable,  a small cuboid with purée and some vegetables. However, the octopus (served with sweet potato puree and a small pot of octopus pearl barley) was dry and flavorless with very very hard skin that I needed to spit out some bites for not being able to chew them, it definitely does not represent the world-famous Portuguese octopus.
After not being asked our opinion about the main dishes, our choice for dessert was the almond cake. While the cake itself (sponge cake with the “Aveirense” egg cream “ovos moles” with some almond flakes on top) was covered with an overwhelming amount of powder sugar, it was served with nice cinnamon ice-cream.
At the end, all we wanted was finishing the meal with a nice cup of coffee, so I ordered an espresso and my friend ordered an “abatanado” (an espresso with some more water) and a “GLASS” of water with coffee. We got coffee from a commercial brand that was almost double the price of specialty coffee at a coffee roaster café, and instead of the glass of water I asked for, I got a 2.5€ 30cl bottle of water.
Maybe having high expectations is the reason behind this negative review but I genuinely find everything we ordered very overpriced for what it is.",2023-06-11T17:47:40.134579Z,FAMA by Luís Lavrador,ChIJGzl6FF-jIw0RqD2xkPwE8to,"{'latitude': 40.625810900000005, 'longitude': -8.645055}",4.7

A I,4,"The portion sizes were pretty huge! We honestly could have shared one of the dishes + 2 soups and therefore been able to eat dessert. However, our waiter wasn’t very informative in that manner. Just wanting to push sales for the tasting menu (we both felt). And thus we were too full to eat dessert :( The food was so good we ordered home delivery again the next day (the polvo). I feel like a dining experience should be the whole package. And for me the service could have been better in terms of actually recommending and advising instead of trying to sell.

Luigi Cervone,2,"Disappointing Experience at Domino's Pizza in Aveiro

I recently visited Domino's Pizza in Aveiro with a group of friends, excited to try the ""all you can eat"" menu that included unlimited drinks. Unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations, and I would like to share my negative review with you.

Upon arrival, we were informed that the ""all you can eat"" menu did not include unlimited drinks as we had anticipated. Instead, we were offered a menu without any drinks included, but at the same price. This discrepancy from the advertised offer left us disappointed, as we had specifically chosen the restaurant for the option of unlimited drinks.

Furthermore, we expressed our dissatisfaction to the staff and the misunderstanding that had occurred. We were disappointed that no discount or remedy was offered for the inconvenience. It would have been appreciated if a gesture of goodwill had been made to compensate for the discomfort caused.

Regarding the food, we were let down by the quality that didn't resemble a real pizza in the slightest. The pizzas lacked flavor, the texture of the crust was not authentic, and it seemed that the ingredients used were of low quality. We didn't expect to have an artisanal pizza, but the difference was so noticeable that it was difficult to truly enjoy the food.

In conclusion, my experience at Domino's Pizza in Aveiro was disappointing due to the lack of unlimited drinks as promised in the ""all you can eat"" menu, the absence of any remedy or discount offered for the inconvenience, and the quality of the food that bore no resemblance to a real pizza. I cannot fully recommend this restaurant to those seeking a satisfying pizza experience.

I hope that my review can be helpful to those looking for alternatives for a pizza evening in Aveiro.",2023-07-07T22:30:41.277307Z,Domino's Pizza Aveiro,ChIJ7wtskLajIw0R5-CO0Z5I99g,"{'latitude': 40.631322399999995, 'longitude': -8.6480351}",4.3
