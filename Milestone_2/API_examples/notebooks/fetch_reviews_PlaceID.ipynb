    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. **Google API Key**: A valid API key with access to **Google Places API**\n",
    "2. **Place ID**: A unique identifier for a place, typically retrieved through **TextSearch** or **Nearby Search**.\n"

    "## Request Parameters\n",
    "The following parameters are used in the API request to fetch **Place Details**:\n",
    "- `place_id`: Unique identifier for the place (e.g., **ChIJRVcQ4aWiIw0RjZYqRqPNL2Y**).\n",
    "- `fields`: Specifies which fields to include in the response. For fetching reviews, we use `name`, `rating`, and `reviews`.\n",
    "- `key`: **Google API Key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: \n",
    "**API Request:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X GET 'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places/ChIJRVcQ4aWiIw0RjZYqRqPNL2Y' \\\n",
