I wanted to share my partner's experience of a cruise in Aveiro. It was a beautiful and pleasant trip, something I'd already experienced several times... not with this company, and yesterday, what a disappointment!!!
€15 for a boat ride led by a grumpy captain who seemed ""at the end of his rope,"" a guide (who wasn't one! Always on her phone, chatting with her daughter, or reading some explanations given once they'd reached the stop...) with zero involvement!! No respect for the passengers who paid what I already found to be a substantial amount, as they turned around in the canal before reaching the end, as other companies did...
One passenger even dozed off a bit... what an atmosphere! A disgrace for the company...

Avoid!! Avoid this company!

Choose another one, even if you have to wait a little longer (the availability of early departures should have alerted me). This boat trip is beautiful when you are in a friendly environment with a committed guide and people who respect tourists... but not this one!",2025-08-08T10:35:55.867530379Z

The ingredients are locally sourced, offering a unique taste of the region that you won’t find elsewhere. Each plate is a testament to his dedication to quality and authenticity.
What truly sets this restaurant apart is the warmth and hospitality. Ricardo treats every guest like family, making you feel as though you’re dining in his own home. His passion for Portuguese cuisine shines through in every interaction and every dish.

You need to choose a room (at a higher price) with a sea view (this means an inner bay, not the open ocean) - these rooms are larger with a big balcony and the view is much nicer than the opposite rooms facing the street.  The rooms facing to the street are also very small. The ocean view also allows you to see flocks of flamingos with binoculars or a cell phone etc. The surroundings are very nice, cute typical Portuguese colorful striped houses, long promenade along them and along the sea. Right next to the hoel is an excellent fish restaurant, fruit/vegetable shop and market with fish, other goodies, cheese, wine, olives pastries and of course a fish restaurant upstairs, pharmacy and big parking place. The beach - open ocean - is a few minutes walk away. The beaches are gorgeous - long stretches of wild, sandy, but manicured beaches, with restaurants where you can watch amazing sunsets while having a carafe of sangria. By car it's a few minutes to the centre of Aveiro and the university, but there is a bus service too. Breakfast is possible in the detached building of the hotel, where there is also a reception with 24 h-service (about 50 m from the hotel villa). The cleaning is precise.

They needed a part and asked for a 50% deposit for the job.  I agreed and they said it would be 2-3 weeks for the part to arrive.  I texted the technician after about a month and he said the part had not arrived. After 2 months later I tried to call the technician and no answer.  I then tried to contact the company and no response.  I finally got them to answer a text and they asked who had worked on the job.  Now another month has passed and I haven't been able to get anyone to answer my texts or calls.  I don't know what happened but they seem to have just quit doing business or something and I am out the deposit.

After the response to my original review, the only contact I have been able to get from them is to refute my review here.  I have sent multiple emails and texts to them but no response.  I am sure this was an honest mistake but they are not even trying to help me rectify it.  Just ignoring it is not good business.

Continuation of my review.  I finally after 3 months of calling, texting, and email got some to actually meet with me today.  It is kind of a raquete.  In most cases when everything goes well they probably do good work, but in case I think I finally understand what they are doing here.  It appears to be a message board for handymen to find jobs.  If they finish the job, everything is great.  In my case, it appears the man doing the job left town, probaby back in July, and now the owner and his salesman, I guess, just say not our problem, our names are not on any of your documents.  The only record that I am sure they have is my initial contact on their website, but like other website messengers I have used it did not send me a copy of my initial email.  So, I have learned, and if I could give them less than 1 star I would.  So, beware maybe other sites are better but I would stay far away from this one, and I still can't find their office in Aveiro.  It looks to me like it doesn't exist.",2024-10-23T18:41:38.864754Z

The restaurant is really well located, and you would think that because of the central location it would be overpriced, but it turned out to be not true. The staff was very professional and friendly, providing excellent service. Now to what matters the most, the food. I ordered the Pasta alla Forma and my wife had the Gnocchi ai 4 Formaggi. The gnocchi were really tasty, soft and the cheese tasted really good. We shared the dish and were left satisfied. As for what was supposed to be the star of the show, the pasta, we, personally, weren't too impressed. Not to say that it was badly done or tasted terrible, no, but it just did not meet our personal expectations and taste. I'm glad I tried it but it's not something I'd be ordering again. The portions were very good but the dishes were also heavy, so we finished everything with a bit of difficulty. We finished the meal with a Tiramisu, which was really soft and melted on the tongue.

The method of cutting nails after applying the polish was strange and improper. Even though the service was incomplete, it took an incredibly long time – a whopping almost 3 hours. The studio was neglected, the equipment outdated, and the gel removal machine operated harshly and painfully. The end result left much to be desired – the nails were uneven.

The bedroom was super clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully laid out. The en-suite bathroom could benefit from a towel rail for drying towels, but otherwise it was great.
The location was a pleasant surprise, the train station is just a three-minute walk away, and there’s also an underground passage that takes you straight to the bus terminal across the road.

The property advertises on Booking.com that a baby cot is available for the selected room. However, upon arrival there was no baby cot, and in any case, it would not have fit in the room as it was far too small.

Additionally, there were no bed sheets provided. When we asked the owner, we were told: “This is not a hotel, but there is a blanket available” — a blanket that had clearly been used by many others before. The level of hygiene was completely unacceptable, and this was never disclosed when making the reservation.

Another major issue was the excessive noise. It felt as though we were staying in a nightclub, with constant disturbance from both other guests inside the apartment and from a bar or club located directly below.

When we contacted the owner to explain that this was not at all what had been advertised and that we wished to cancel, we were told: “Sorry, you are already checked in, so we cannot do anything.” The service was not only unhelpful but also delivered in an arrogant manner.

We have already raised this matter with Booking.com and will also make it known to other platforms.

Overall, the stay was not even worth €10. Even a hostel would have been a far better option.",2025-09-09T20:01:43.977214850Z

They advertise on booking.com that they have a crib available for the selected room.
Once on-site, there's no crib available, and it doesn't fit in the room anyway; it's far too small.

They don't have any sheets to cover you up. After asking the owner, they say, ""Yes, this isn't a hotel, but there is a blanket available (which has probably already been used by 100 others). Hygiene is lacking. This isn't mentioned when booking either.

Finally, it feels like being in a nightclub. There's a terrible amount of noise, both from the other people in the apartment and from some kind of nightclub/bar below.

I contacted the owner and told them this is absolutely not what they advertise and that we want to cancel. They said, ""Sorry, we've already checked you in and can't do anything more for you.""

I recently visited Domino's Pizza in Aveiro with a group of friends, excited to try the ""all you can eat"" menu that included unlimited drinks. Unfortunately, the experience fell short of our expectations, and I would like to share my negative review with you.

Upon arrival, we were informed that the ""all you can eat"" menu did not include unlimited drinks as we had anticipated. Instead, we were offered a menu without any drinks included, but at the same price. This discrepancy from the advertised offer left us disappointed, as we had specifically chosen the restaurant for the option of unlimited drinks.

Furthermore, we expressed our dissatisfaction to the staff and the misunderstanding that had occurred. We were disappointed that no discount or remedy was offered for the inconvenience. It would have been appreciated if a gesture of goodwill had been made to compensate for the discomfort caused.

Regarding the food, we were let down by the quality that didn't resemble a real pizza in the slightest. The pizzas lacked flavor, the texture of the crust was not authentic, and it seemed that the ingredients used were of low quality. We didn't expect to have an artisanal pizza, but the difference was so noticeable that it was difficult to truly enjoy the food.

In conclusion, my experience at Domino's Pizza in Aveiro was disappointing due to the lack of unlimited drinks as promised in the ""all you can eat"" menu, the absence of any remedy or discount offered for the inconvenience, and the quality of the food that bore no resemblance to a real pizza. I cannot fully recommend this restaurant to those seeking a satisfying pizza experience.

I hope that my review can be helpful to those looking for alternatives for a pizza evening in Aveiro.",2023-07-07T22:30:41.277307Z

The food was truly exceptional. We started with a delicious plate of bruschetta, followed by a creamy risotto di zucca and a classic spaghetti alla carbonara. Both dishes were cooked to perfection, with the flavors blending harmoniously. To finish, we indulged in a decadent profiterole, which was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.

While there was a minor oversight with our dessert order, the staff quickly rectified the situation with apologies, demonstrating their commitment to customer satisfaction.

For those who like traditional Francesinha be aware that the only resemblance to a typical francesinha is the sandwich, the sauce is really far from the traditional typical Francesinha sauce, it seems to be a cheddar and tomato based sauce making it a bit sweet. But nevertheless it was a great Francesinha and I really enjoyed the different spin on the sauce, it makes it interesting and it was tasty, the sandwich was really good and the ingredients used all tasted high quality.

We consider ourselves as regular customers of this restaurant. Today we came there and asked for slices of pizza. We chose a vegetarian one which they had to make. Then they brought it saying that now it looks different... (they couldn't say it before), it isn't the same one as on the menu, it is economic version with only 2 ingredients which they make when someone ask ONLY for slices.
When I looked properly there were some roughly cut tomatoes and bunch of onion...Pizza de Cebolada 😉.
After first bite I got very disappointed. Absolutely tasteless thing, just some strange low-cost product which wasn't edible.

This is very shameful, it had never happened to us. Always they made a big size pizza, cut slices and sold the rest. My day wasn't perfect today and I was quite hungry and I received such disappointment.

Fortunately there are many other options to go to eat in Aveiro so I will try one of them next time 🙂.

We were just passing through and needed a cheap place to stay for one night. Expecting a hotel, we were surprised to find out it was a youth hostel upon arrival. This is just an observation, not a negative judgment.

The rooms were very basic, and the windows only tilted open, which was unpleasant in the summer heat. The showers were particularly unhygienic: the water didn't drain, they were dirty, and they smelled bad. Aside from that, the rest of the accommodation was clean. Unfortunately, some of the other guests didn't always respect the quiet hours, which was a bit bothersome.

We found it unusual that we were supposed to leave our room keys in a basket at the reception whenever we left the building. After a short discussion where we pointed out the security risk—that someone could simply grab a random key and enter a stranger’s room—we were allowed to keep our key.

The breakfast was tasty and there was a good variety.

The price of €39 for two people was very cheap. For this price, you can't expect luxury, but the accommodation was perfectly fine for one night.",2025-08-18T14:24:32.029349960Z

- Due to the disposition of the tables, it is possible to observe what happens behind the counter and, unfortunately, we saw an employee sneeze right into their hands and then, a few moments later, put nori seaweed directly with his hands inside the ramen bowl.

Although this is enough for a sanitary nightmare, in terms of ramen, the flavour is nothing out of the ordinary (had way better ones in Porto or even at home) and it is not worth the 15€.

1254,0.0,0.38060879707336426,"Monlou, Cake and Coffee House",1,"We decided to go to Mon Lou for brunch with some friends who frequent there every weekend more or less, the treatment we received from one of the female waitresses with the blonde hair was offensive and uncalled for.

We ordered a variety of tosta mistas, iced coffee and a waffle. The tosta mistas came less toasted than what our friends usually receive and from what we like as well, we politely asked if the waitress could toast them a little more, a reasonable request, we are not returning the food. The reaction of the waitress was to take the plates with an attitude, no apology or acknowledgment, as if we are inconveniencing and offending her.

Firstly, no one said the food was poor, purely that we prefer the sandwich when it is crunchy and golden, not chewy and white on the outside, like everyone. When the waitress returned with the tosta mistas now toasted to our preference, she drops them on the table with an attitude and asks if our friends enjoyed the waffle, they said ""yes thank you it was very good"", to my absolute disbelief the waitress responds with a very rude and brazen tone ""pelo menos isso"" (at least this).

My tosta mista with chicken mayo was average, you can see from the picture the amount of chicken they put is very little, they ratio of chicken to mayonnaise is also off so you have no taste of the chicken and the mayo makes it quite sickening. The cheese used was not of good quality and lacked taste, also it states that they put oregano, but they put so little and only on the outside that you cannot taste it, so it is pointless.

I can say the iced coffee was very good, not too sweet and I liked how they blended the ice with the coffee, similar to how Starbucks or cafes in the US do it.

However, I will not be returning to this establishment as I do not pay money in exchange for a waitress that is so miserable with her own life that she needs to be rude for free to people she doesn't even know. I advised the owner to have a word with the waitress, whether she does who knows, I won't be returning.

If you do not like to be treated like a second class citizen without education, then avoid this place, there are plenty other establishments in Aveiro who treat their customers with respect and at minimum, a smile.",2021-07-17T10:31:56.312680Z

The interview impressed me and I reached out to Rafael and he setup an initial Zoom Call and explained the entire Mortgage Process to me, for US expats moving to Portugal and planning to buy property.

I submitted all the documents needed for Mortgage via a Shared Google Drive and Rafael and his team got working on it immediately. They helped me with finding a good Mixed Rate with multiple banks. They also helped me open a Bank Account at NovoBanco using a Lawyer, all done remotely.

We finally closed the Public Deed on time and I travelled to Madeira for the Deed and we got the Keys to the property in Feb 2024.

Rafael and his team (Frederico Franca) provided exceptional service and made the process totally smooth. They reached out to my builder to get all the documents needed for the Deed and liaised with the NovoBanco Bank Manager on my behalf to make sure everything gets done on time and there are no hiccups during the Public Deed Closing.

If you are planning to buy property in Portugal, please go with Rafael and his team for your Mortgage Needs. They are the most professional and the best team out there helping US and EU expats buy property in Portugal and get a Mortgage.

Originally built in the early 15th century as a tidal-powered watermill, the structure was developed atop the canal arches known as Casa dos Arcos. Over the 19th and 20th centuries, it served various purposes—first as a warehouse for coal and citrus, then as a printing house for a local newspaper, and even housed Aveiro's first steam engine. In 1903, it became home to the School of Industrial Design. From 1919, it functioned as the office of a maritime company, and from 1925 to 1993, it served as the official building for the Port Authority of Aveiro (Capitania).

So amazing that I am currently writing this review from inside the restaurant!!
We got the couvert of the day which i highly recommend. Crackers instead of bread so it wasn’t super filling and the olives came in the tastiest olive oil. If there is one dish you have to get it is the garlic shrimp tapas. Quite literally the BEST shrimp I’ve had in my entire life. I was in heaven, it was bliss. So amazing. You have to get it, the portion is also generous and comes with 10+ big shrimp.

The octopus tapas was also really good and has a unique seasoning and sauce. It wasn’t chewy at all, even though octopus usually is. We also got the goat cheese salad which was good with fresh dressing and cheese. Lastly we got the steak. While it was good, it doesn’t compare to the rest of the meal. It still has a good flavor and tenderness and came with delicious potato wedges and sauce.

1664,2.0,0.6895099878311157,Bordalo II - Rã,4,"Bordalo II's Rã is one of the most iconic works by Portuguese artist Bordalo II, known for his urban installations made from discarded materials and recycled waste. This enormous, colorful frog is part of the ""Big Trash Animals"" series, with which the artist denounces human impact on the environment and the destruction of biodiversity.

Reflective Art
The work, visible in several Portuguese cities, is constructed entirely from discarded plastic, metal, rubber, and everyday objects, transformed into a gigantic, surprisingly lifelike and powerful animal. The Rã (frog), in addition to its strong visual impact, sends a clear message: nature suffers under the weight of our waste.

Why see it?
- It's an extraordinary example of sustainable street art.
- It's striking for its creativity, technique, and social significance.

The worst part of all was that when we contacted the management, we found the phone was off, and when they answered the next morning (because there's no reception), they just washed their hands of it, saying, ""What the hell are we surprised about?""

I rarely leave negative reviews, but my experience at Binho was disappointing enough that I feel compelled to share.

I ordered what was one of the more expensive bottles on the menu, expecting a quality pour. Unfortunately, the wine was clearly off — either poorly stored or past its prime. I politely brought this to the staff’s attention, hoping for a reasonable resolution.

What made the situation worse wasn’t just the wine itself, but how the owner handled it. Rather than addressing the concern with professionalism or even basic courtesy, I was met with defensiveness and a dismissive attitude. There was no genuine attempt to listen or make it right — something I’d expect from any establishment, especially one that positions itself as a WINE BAR.

Everyone makes mistakes, and sometimes bottles do go bad — that’s understandable. But how a business chooses to handle those moments speaks volumes about its values and service standards. Sadly, in this case, the response left a sour taste that went far beyond the wine.

I hope Binho takes this as an opportunity to improve how they handle customer concerns in the future.",2025-07-05T10:38:25.384942074Z

I wanted to charge it a little while I had some coffee.
Moreover, I had already done this in other cafes in the area and no one allowed themselves to behave like that with me.
And what’s more, I don’t behave with my clients and they can always charge their phone or scooter when they relax with us.
When I finished my coffee and started reading the newspaper, a waiter boy came up to me and said that I was wasting a lot of their electricity, and this woman immediately ran up and shooed me away in a rude tone and said that I should have asked permission first and that it was expensive.
When I asked how much and where the indicator about the amount weighed, she ran away.

In my quest to explore the rich culinary traditions of Portugal, I found myself at this charming restaurant, where the essence of traditional Portuguese cuisine takes center stage. The experience was a testament to the country’s reputation for generous portions, bold flavors, and heartfelt hospitality.

My meal began with a classic Portuguese soup, a warm and comforting dish that exemplified simplicity done right. The ingredients were fresh, and the flavors were well-balanced, providing a perfect introduction to what lay ahead.

For the main course, I chose the grilled cod—a dish synonymous with Portuguese gastronomy. The portion was impressively generous, reflecting the restaurant's commitment to hospitality. The cod was expertly prepared, with a beautifully charred exterior that locked in its natural flavors while remaining moist and flaky inside. Paired with traditional accompaniments, this dish truly showcased the depth of Portugal’s culinary heritage.

The portions, as mentioned, were substantial, ensuring that no guest leaves unsatisfied. This, combined with the attention to flavor and preparation, elevates the restaurant to a must-visit status for those seeking an authentic Portuguese dining experience.

We've been scammed before, so we are very careful when asking for recommendations from restaurant staff. She mentioned that she doesn’t recommend tap water because of the salt content. She seemed to automatically expect us to agree to her wine recommendation and got irritated with our simple questions. She was less friendly compared to how she was initially before we asked.

When you travel often, you frequently encounter bad experiences, and I hope she understands that travelers like us learn to guard and protect ourselves from possible scams. There was nothing wrong with our questions for her to get upset. We didn't even take much time to ask about the price of the wine. Should we just believe her when she says it's cheap? I wasn't feeling well that day, and the ambience didn't feel good.

We ordered one soup, but two arrived, and of course, we were charged for two. The soup was mediocre; I think it was pumpkin soup. I've made better at home. They delivered food to our table with no explanation at all, and it took so long, with dishes arriving one by one. Are we supposed to eat just potatoes and salad?

The food was amazing, presentation and flavors. You can tell the quality of ingredients they use and how they innovate. The oven rice was amazing. The meat was soft, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The croquettes were unlike anything I've tried before and the shrimp empanadas were rich and flavorful.

Everything is very well thought out, the photographs, the information provided, etc. You don't realize what's going on until you get far enough away. And that's when you realize what they're really offering you is a shared apartment, full of lies.
Because it doesn't have a pool, a hair salon, or reception until 8 p.m., the rooms are very noisy, there's a lack of security, flimsy doors and locks, and no public parking.
In our experience, we were quite lucky with the people we shared with, a very nice couple from Madrid in the same situation as us.
As for the location and decor, they were very good, but the shower in the RV I rented two years ago was larger. Two of the three bedrooms were quite small and poorly ventilated, with no air conditioning, although it was necessary. The beds were very comfortable, but not enough to make up for all the negatives.

Gliding through the canals on those colorful boats is fun and gives you a nice feel for the city’s charm.

I’m only docking one star because our guide seemed a bit inexperienced — we got the basic history about Aveiro’s salt trade and its famous sweet ovos moles, but not much beyond that.

Maybe the guide was just new, or maybe Aveiro itself doesn’t have much to talk about — hard to tell!

That said, at around €15 per person, it’s still absolutely worth doing.

If you can, request an older or more seasoned guide for a richer experience.

I only had one day in Aveiro, and while it’s often called the “Venice of Portugal,” I personally found it a bit quiet compared to other Portuguese cities.

Also, the variety of options is quite wide for sweets as well as for baked goods. However, when we chose the seat it seemed like nobody cared about our presence. We spent more than 10min just to ask for a coffee. There was only one waitress serving almost everyone inside(although there were other waitresses who were chill and not busy at all) and was very busy although the place was only half full. Of course, the way we were served couldn't be friendly in this kind of situation. This cafe definitely needs some improvements in their service. Then, the cake we ordered was disappointing: just super sweet, nothing else. Dry and wet at the same time, no cacao flavor in the dough. As for the price (around 3€), it's quality was bad.
As for the paying, it was another struggle, coming from someone who was here for the first time ever, it was confusing to find a line to pay. And on top of that our order wasn't registered correctly. Maybe it was just a bad luck for us.",2022-09-01T16:27:01.040251Z

He was asked to frame a unique triptych photographic artwork by a Chinese artist that was supposed to become a single picture, but it turned out that during the printing process the Chinese artist had made a mistake causing for the three parts not to line up. Ricardo informed me of this mistake and proposed a solution which turned out to be better and more beautiful than the original work by digitally reprinting the artwork on a special paper and using a non-reflecting glass in the frame.

Polite staff, although the service was very slow. To be fair, we were a large group, but the result was that half of the dishes arrived first and the rest later, with some being hot and others cold.

The atmosphere is modern, with a simple yet elegant decoration. The food was excellent. We ordered a starter the O Pastel De Bacalhau. As main we ordered Lombo De Robalo, Tomate e o Manjericão and Bacalhau e a Manga. Both beautifully cooked, full of flavor and presented with care. Portions are generous, and the service throughout the evening was good, however not spectacular. Which is spectacular though is the presentation of the desserts. Both, Laranja e os Sabores Do Bosque and  O Amendoim e o Caramelo are being put to fire for some show effect. Necessary? No. Fun to watch? For sure.

We have visited the place a month ago, just able now to write this review. We came to the place for it had good reviews, but if we had a slight idea about how we will be treated we would have never visited that place. Upon ordering, we asked for the tomato butter that comes as an entry and their special paté.
The guy asked any bread? We said no thanks. In a very sarcastic rude way and an arrogant smile on his face he said: so how will you be eating the butter and tomato?
My husband politely told him we thought that it is already served with it. He said: No!
We then asked only for the paté, and the 2 main dishes ( 2 different seafood risottos) and white wine. We had the wine at first, and kept waiting for more than 20 minutes for anything to be served. Before those 20 mins, he came by and said that the food is being ready that he can see it almost done. We reminded him that we had asked for the paté. He confidently said: I know! And left us.
After a while, still nothing is served. Only the main dished after 25 minutes. We were surprised and asked him about the same thing again, he said I forgot, sorry! I was really tired and the food was already late and he was unbelievable due to his attitude so I quietly said It's ok, while I was already planning to write here what happened instead of making a fuss!
Seriously what kind of service was this!!!
On a fair note, the dishes were incredible and tasty. Seafood was fresh and the risotto was delicious. The only thing that has disappointed us specially that it was one of those first restaurants to visit in Portugal is the service. I recommend the food, the place was clean and quiet, but the service is not what we have expected at all.

We’ve visited this restaurant many times and have for the most part, enjoyed every outing. Most of our visits here are in the off season and perhaps when things are busier, there might be different staff working. The waiter that usually serves us is Antonio. He is a down to earth guy who makes you feel right at home. He’ll talk to you like you were a family member. How typical Portuguese. Nothing wrong with that in my book. After all, remember where you are. Service is quick and commentary by Antonio is always aplenty. Maybe some people don’t like that. If that’s the case, there are always restaurants around that charge you double than what they charge here and the waiter will only say “yes sir or no sir”.

We would have understood if we weren't in a city, but we weren't expecting it. When we told the front desk, they were extremely accomodating and had a cancelation, so they were able to move us the next day. The new room was good, very quiet. The hotel was also extremely clean. The beds were a bit uncomfortable but not worth a 1 star, but for sure a 3 star. The service made up for any inconviences encountered, I would stay here again.

2460,1.0,0.9276871085166931,VENEZA HOTEL,5,"The hotel was incredible. The decor was very old-fashioned, but really beautiful and everything was spotless. The room was very clean and lovely, with a view of a small pond with fish, and there was a terrace behind it, probably used for breakfast.

The staff was extremely kind and welcoming — they helped us with any information we needed.

The only issue was parking. The hotel’s parking lot was full, and although there are many spots outside, they were always taken. It was also confusing because in some areas you have to pay and in others you don’t. Even when we parked in a free zone, we paid just in case, because it wasn’t clear. But that’s not the hotel’s fault.

Other than that, the hotel was amazing, very comfortable, and I highly recommend it.",2025-08-05T08:07:56.920338766Z

I am sure they are experts for full body massage and facial treatment. I did try the feet massage - my expectations were different than the service I received.

They handled the situation very well and professionally and in the end I am happy with the outcome.

The masseurs was a very lovely and friendly lady from Ukraine.
